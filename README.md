# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Text
A simple sentiment detection model using standard NLTK liberary. The model is able to detect wether the text posted by individual has positive or negetive emotions attached to it. The words used in the dataset for training the model are not totally perfect for the classification of positive or negetive but they are pretty much giving a good accuracy.

## Requirements
I have attached a requirement.txt file for installing the dependencies.
